// node mergeSortedArrays.js

// Given two sorted integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return a new array that combines both of them and is also sorted.
arr1 = [1, 4, 7, 20];
arr2 = [3, 5, 6];

// explain the algorithm and the steps you're going to use to solve it in comments
// then code it out!

// console.log(combine(arr1, arr2));
